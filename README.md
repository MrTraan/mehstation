# mehstation


`mehstation` is a multi-launcher frontend fully driven by a gamepad/keyboard.

You configure your platforms (Steam, Native, Emulator, ...) and the executables to launch on these platforms (Steam AppId, binary, ROMs, ...) and you'll have an interface usable to launch everything using a gamepad controller or a keyboard.

## Developer infos
